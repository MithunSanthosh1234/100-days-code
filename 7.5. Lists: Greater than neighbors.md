# Statement
### Given a list of numbers, determine and print the number of elements that are greater than both of their neighbors.

### The first and the last items of the list shouldn't be considered because they don't have two neighbors.

```

# Python Code:
```
a = [int(s) for s in input().split()]
# Print a value:
# print(a)
elements = 0
for i in range(1, len(a) - 1):
  if a[i - 1] < a[i] > a[i + 1]:
    elements += 1
print(elements)
