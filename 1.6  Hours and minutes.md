# Statement
## Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight. Therefore, the time now is 1:05am. So the program should print 1 65 - 1 full hour is passed since midnight, 65 full minutes passed since midnight.  


```
Example input
3900

Example output
1 65

```

## Python Code:

```
a = int(input())

m=(a//60)
h=(m//60)
print(str(h),str(m))
```
