# JugsMugsPugs LITE
### Write a program that receives a number on the input.
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints "Jugs". 
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, it prints "Mugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, it prints "Pugs".

  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of both 5 and 7, it prints "MugsPugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs".

Otherwise, it prints the number.

### LITE REQUIREMENT:
